A simple to use, elegant image gallery with an automatic slideshow feature. 

== Description ==
A simple and clean way to show off your images. No need for people to page through your gallery as FotoExposé keeps it all on one page. A thumbnail indicator lets users know exactly what image they are viewing. FotoExposé has an automatic slideshow displaying each image at a specific interval. Your images deserve the best presentation and we think you are going to love FotoExposé,


== Installation ==
1. Install Plugin
2. Create a new page
3. Place this text in the body [fotoexpose][/fotoexpose]
4. Insert images between the tags

The thumbnails will be the size set in Wordpress Settings>Media. I recommend they are not taller than 96px. Although it is totally up to you. If you want a custom thumbnail size you must change this setting before uploading the images. You can change it back after uploading. FotoExposé uses the Wordpress Setting>Media \"Large Size\" for the large images.

To remove gallery, simply delete the tags and images
